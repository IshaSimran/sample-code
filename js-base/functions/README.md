## Function Declarations vs Function Expressions
There are two common ways to create a function:

### Function Declaration
Also referred to as a function statement, this is a classic syntax common to many languages. Function declarations load the function into memory during the Creation Phase (iow, the function variable is "hoisted").

```js
function greet() {
  console.log('Hi!');
}
```


### Function Expression
Function expressions return the function as a value, which can later be assigned to a variable using the assignment operator `=`.

```js
const greetMe = function() {
	console.log('Hi Tony!');
}
```
