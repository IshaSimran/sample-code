### Basic Usage
#### Linking the Font Awesome Library
There are a few ways to include Font Awesome Icons into your page. We recommend the CDNJS content delivery network:
1. Navigate to the [Font Awesome library on CDNJS](https://cdnjs.com/libraries/font-awesome).
2. Copy the HTML `link` code from the desired icon set. For now, you can use `all.min.css` but try to use a subset such as `solid.min.css` if you don't need all icons.
3. Paste the copied code into the `head` of your HTML page, or into the HTML panel of a Codepen (this is the only time you should link CSS from within the `body`).
