# CSS Grid Examples
## Classic 2-column layout with sidebar
[Demo](classic-sidebar-layout)

### Activities
1. This demo is not responsive. Using a media query, create a breakpoint at `600px` (either mobile or desktop-first) where the layout is a single column on mobile devices.
2. This demo lacks navigation. Add a "My Navigation" element that spans both columns similar to the `header` and `footer`.
