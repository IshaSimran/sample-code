# CSS Grid Examples
## 1. Classic 2-column layout with sidebar
[Demo](classic-sidebar-layout)

### Activities
1. This demo is not responsive. Using a media query, create a breakpoint at `600px` (either mobile or desktop-first) where the layout is a single column on mobile devices.
2. This demo lacks navigation. Add a "My Navigation" element that spans both columns similar to the `header` and `footer`.

## 2. Checker pattern using `repeat()`
[Demo](checker-pattern)

### Activities
1. Using your search skills, find an online tutorial/Codepen/article that uses grid to create a chess board.
