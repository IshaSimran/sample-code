# Retreiving data asynchronously with `fetch()`

## Activity: API hunt
[Starter Code](starter)

### Instructions
1. Pick a [public JSON API](https://github.com/public-apis/public-apis) that:
    - _DOES NOT_ require authentication;
    - _DOES_ support CORS.
    Hint: Use [Postman](https://www.postman.com/) to inspect the JSON. For beginners: aim for an API that returns a single, unnested object.
2. Using the starter code above, add the data to a web page by manipulating the DOM.
