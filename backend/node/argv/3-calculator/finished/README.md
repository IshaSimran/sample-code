This code works but it could be better:
- Add checks for the proper arguments, in the proper order. In other words, the `operator` should be first, then followed by two numbers (`operand1` and `operand2`).
- Add checks so that you can't divide by zero! Don't destroy the multi-universe.
- Add support for more mathematical operations. Exponents, log, etc.
