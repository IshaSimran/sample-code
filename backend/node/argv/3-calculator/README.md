# Activity: Command Line Arithmetic Calculator
## Instructions
1. Copy this [starter code](starter/calculator.js) into a new project folder.
2. Using `process.argv`, refactor the `calculator` script to return the proper result based on the `operator` and operands provided. For example: typing `node calculator.js add 20 5` into the terminal should return `25`:
    1. Navigate to the [starter code](starter/calcu;ator.js) directory from the command line. 
    2. Use `process.argv` to import `operator`, `operand1` and `operand2` arguments from the command line.
    3. Based on these arguments, `console.log` the (correct) final tip amount to the console.
